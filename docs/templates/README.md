# Documentation Templates

This directory contains templates for creating new documentation. These
templates are inspired by the
[Modular Documentation Project](https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs).
There are templates for assemblies, concepts, procedures, and references.

To begin a new document, choose an appropriate template, copy the template
to your new file location, and begin editing. For more information about which
template to use, please see the templates themselves and the modular documentation
project's advice on
[Writing Modular Documentation](https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#writing-mod-docs).
